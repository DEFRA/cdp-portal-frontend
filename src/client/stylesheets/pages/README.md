# Page styles

Where possible specific styles should be avoided in favour of more generic styles. This will help to keep the
codebase maintainable and reduce the amount of CSS that needs to be written. In some cases this is not possible or
simply not wise to try and force something to be generic. Then you can create "page" specific styles.
