      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How you should be able to use this website</h2>
      <p>We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website.</p>
      <p>You should be able to:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Change colours, contrast levels and fonts using browser or device settings</li>
        <li>Zoom in up to 200% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
        <li>Navigate most of the website using a keyboard or speech recognition software</li>
        <li>Listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and
          VoiceOver)
        </li>
        <li>We also make the website text as simple as possible to understand</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How accessible this website is</h2>
      <p>Parts of this website are not fully accessible. For example:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Some pages do not reflow correctly</li>
        <li>Some pages reload automatically</li>
        <li>Some pages have very long lists</li>
        <li>Form errors do not alert screen readers</li>
        <li>
          We have a number of improvements we are making to the website to improve accessibility. These tickets,
          with further details, can be seen in our backlog
        </li>
      </ul>

        text: "Have some questions around accessibility?"
      }) }}
